Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Git

Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Python
 (if your project uses it)

Steps to Add Your Project to GitHub

Initialize Git in Your Project Directory

Open VS Code and launch the integrated terminal (Ctrl + ). Navigate to your project folder and run:

git init


This command initializes a new Git repository in your project directory.

Stage Your Files

Add all files to the staging area:

git add .


This prepares your files for the initial commit.

Commit Your Changes

Commit the staged files with a descriptive message:

git commit -m "Initial commit"


This records the snapshot of your project.

Create a New Repository on GitHub

Navigate to GitHub
 and log in.

Click on the + icon in the top-right corner and select New repository.

Name your repository (e.g., ai-email-assistant).

Optionally, add a description.

Do not initialize with a README, .gitignore, or License, as you'll be pushing an existing repository.

Click Create repository.

Link Your Local Repository to GitHub

In your VS Code terminal, add the remote repository:

git remote add origin https://github.com/Boomikareddy/ai-email-assistant.git


Replace the URL with your repository's URL.

Push Your Local Repository to GitHub

Push your changes to the main branch:

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main


This uploads your local commits to GitHub.
